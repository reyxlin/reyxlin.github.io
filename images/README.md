## Project Images

The following SVG files are used as placeholders for project thumbnails. You can replace these with your own images:

- placeholder-project1.svg
- placeholder-project2.svg
- placeholder-project3.svg
- placeholder-project4.svg

For project thumbnails, use images with a 4:3 aspect ratio (e.g., 400x300px) for best results.

## Image Optimization

For better website performance, consider optimizing your images before uploading:
- Compress JPG and PNG files to reduce file size
- Use appropriate dimensions (don't use 4000px wide images if they'll only be displayed at 1200px)
- Consider using modern formats like WebP for better compression

## File Formats

- Use JPG for photographs
- Use PNG for images that require transparency
- Use SVG for icons and simple graphics
